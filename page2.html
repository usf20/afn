<p style="color:white">Student rights are those rights, such as civil, constitutional, contractual and consumer rights, 
which regulate student rights and freedoms and allow students to make use of their educational investment. 
These include such things as the right to free speech and association, to due process, equality, autonomy,
 safety and privacy, and accountability in contracts and advertising, which regulate the treatment of students by teachers and administrators. 
 
 There is very little scholarship about student rights throughout the world.

 In general most countries have some kind of student rights (or rights that apply in the educational setting)
 enshrined in their laws and proceduralized by their court precedents.
 Some countries, like Romania, in the European Union, have comprehensive student bills of rights, which outline both rights and how they are to be proceduralized. 
 Most countries, however, like the United States and Canada, 
 do not have a cohesive bill of rights and students must use the courts to determine how rights precedents in one area apply in their own jurisdictions.</p>
